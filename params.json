{"name":"status-board","tagline":"Node.js application to feed system stats into Panic's Status Board","body":"***status-board*** is a node.js application designed to provide real time server stats to Panic's Status Board dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n- node.js 0.8.x or newer\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. Clone this repository, and change to it\r\n2. Edit `config.json` to change the port, auth or enable SSL\r\n3. Type `npm install` to install the dependencies\r\n4. Type `node app.js` to start the API\r\n\r\n## Configuration Options\r\n### Authentication (disabled)\r\nTo enable authentication, add this object to your configuration, and set the user/pass combinations as required.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"auth\": {\r\n\t\"localhost\": {\r\n\t\t\"authRealm\": \"Private\",\r\n\t\t\"authList\": [\"user:pass\"]\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hostname (localhost)\r\nTo change the default hostname, change the key under \"vhosts\" to the new hostname.\r\n\r\n### Port (8000)\r\nTo change the default port from 8000, change the \"port\" value. To run on a low port such as 80, or 443, please create a new key:value pair named \"uid\" with the UID of the account to drop to after starting the application; elevated priviliges are required to start on low ports, but the application shouldn't continue to run as that account.\r\n\r\n### Refresh (15 seconds)\r\nTo change the refresh of Status Board, change the \"refresh\" value to the desired number of seconds. Lower than 15 appears to have no affect.\r\n\r\n### SSL (disabled)\r\nTo enable SSL change the `null` values under \"ssl\" to file paths.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
